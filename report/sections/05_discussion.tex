\chapter{Discussion}

% -------- Instructions for writing the discussion section:
% The discussion section gives an interpretation of what you have done \cite{day2006wap}:

% \begin{itemize}
 % \item \textit{What do your results mean?} Here you discuss, but you do not recapitulate results. Describe principles, relationships and generalizations shown. Also, mention inconsistencies or exceptions you found.
 % \item \textit{How do your results relate to other's work?} Show how your work agrees or disagrees with other's work. You can rely on the information you presented in the ``related work'' section.
 % \item \textit{What are the implications and applications of your work?} State how your methods may be applied and what implications might be. 
% \end{itemize}

% \noindent Make sure that the introduction/related work and the discussion section act as a pair, i.e. ``be sure the discussion section answers what the introduction section asked'' \cite{day2006wap}. 


\section{Discussion}
% - What was surprisingly hard
% -- explicit methods are really bad for sparse view settings and unlike implicit methods, they cannot really interpolate well between the known views
% -- even state of the art pose estimators still struggle with complex interactions and occlusions
% -- I expected DiFix to be better it seems that the model is simply lackign human priors
% -- Overall, comin up with good preprocessing pipeline was really challenging and time consuming, I started with 4D humans to realise that this gives me only local poses and also only SMPL

\section{Limitations}
% - Failure cases
% - Assumptions that do not hold
% Scalability and generalization limits
% - in general, the method is still quite slow, taking between 15 to 30 minutes to run whole pipleine 
% - also since it is multi step pipeline, there are many interdependent components, and installing all the environment dependencies can be quite challenging
